I've been practicing violin 3-4 times per week for the last nine months. Through that experience, I have learned a few lessons that I believe are worth sharing.

**Be kind to yourself when it comes to learning new things:** When I first started playing, the perfectionist in me spent a significant amount of time criticizing each note. It took some serious introspection and a steep amount of mindfulness to get through a practice session without a ton of head trash getting in the way. At this point, I have learned to accept where I'm at with violin and to be proud of the progress rather than attached to the result.

**Ask a Professional:** The first 3-4 months of learning, I depended on a wonderful mobile application called [Trala](https://www.trala.com/). Trala worked really well for me, until it didn't. I found myself struggling with basic concepts and not having someone to ask made building momentum unnecessarily challenging.

Eventually I let go of needing to be a self-taught violinist and asked for help. I found a great violin teacher that does remote lessons, and meeting with him twice per month has helped me more than words can express. 

**Stage Freight is Real:** When your friends and family find out that you're learning an instrument, they will inevitably ask if you will play it for them. I am still working through how to be okay with this and to not almost shout "no" when asked. I don't have the answer for this one yet, other than to trust that the person who is asking will not criticize or judge you. And if they do, that says more about that person than it does about your ability. 

Having a new musical instrument as a hobby in my late 20's has been an incredible experience so far. As an engineer by trade, losing myself in my violin has saved my sanity more times than I can count.

If you have access to an instrument that you're interested in learning - give it a shot! It takes some persistance, humility, and patience;  but I really believe that in the long run you will be glad that you did.
